# A for Basics

U have a computer it takes in input can do processing and produce output<br>
<div class="note">no u don't always need input for getting a output</div><br>
Very basic haha<br>
Now u play game they take input from u for example keypress and mouse input and they do some magic and display the game<br>
And a game is a program<br>
So programming is fun Cuz maths is not<br>

## How to do this magic
Its simple (actually not without programming languages) u give instruction to cpu to perform some operations

operations can include things like adding values or reading or writing files and much more

some task can be completed with 1 operation and some with many

consider this like a maths problem u apply logic and step by step solve it

but in computer u don't need to solve any thing u just need to build ur logic tell computer what to do

like for example u have to multiply 2 number in maths u will have take page and pen and then u would multiply<br>
aaaah very hard 

In computer u tell computer hey here are two number multiply them and give me back the result so simple :\)

Computer is like ur servant u tell it do something and it do it. The only difference is that ur real servant has a brain and u can ask it to solve for x in x = some very large complex equation and it will solve but computer wont u will need to tell it exactly how to solve it and then it will

U need to understand this concept before u start to code
"U provide instruction to ur computer on how to solve a problem and it will follow them"

very simple :\)
