# E for Java

## Some Info about java

Read if u want to or skip

Java was created by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. The project, initially named "Oak," aimed to develop software for consumer electronics like interactive television. However, the language later evolved and was renamed "Java" to reflect its new focus and potential for use in web development.

## Why Java so KOOL

- U write code and it run on any machine (well not any but almost all)
- Its easy to code in
- Is a old and gold language
- Very large number of people use it so u can find solution to any of ur problem easily
- It has soo many stuff in its development kit

## How to install and setup java

Before u do that a little theory (I will explain this later in depth)

The code u write in java is compiled to **bytecode** by **javac** that is then run by **jvm**

omg soo many new terms plz don't go away let me explain them to u

**BYTECODE** : Its is a sequence of very special code that jvm can understand it will read instructions in bytecode and then it send ur cpu instruction of what to do (jvm has magic)

<div class="note">
Bytecode is not same as cpu instructions they are both different jvm just translate bytecode to cpu instruction at run time
</div>

**JVM** : Imagine it like a translator it takes in bytecode and translate those to cpu instruction that ur computer can understand. people who made java made jvm for every machine so people can install it and then they can run any compiled java code

**javac** : its a compiler that convert ur java code to bytecode so any machine that have jvm installed can run ur bytecode


So how do u get these software

Java got u bro

we have **jre** and **jdk**

again i did it i put random words that u don't know lol its funny

wait let me explain they are just bundles of software that u will need

**JRE** : its short form for Java Runtime Environment "wtf dose it mean what is it" thats what u thought no worries i will tell u jre is a bundle of software that u will need to run any compiled java program yes i said compiled u cant just run java code that u write directly

**JDK** : It is Java Development kit it is made for u the programmer it contains **javac** the java compiler many pre made java program that will be useful later and it also have jre in it

So know u know that u need JDK cuz we gonna write java code and compile it and send it to our friend who don't code and that friend need JRE so he can run ur compiled code

## How to install JDK

Well there are many version of JDK i will use JDK 11

### for windows
Click here -> [Download JDK](https://download.bell-sw.com/java/11.0.19+7/bellsoft-jdk11.0.19+7-windows-amd64.msi)

Then double click when downloaded then follow its instruction to install it

### for mac os

sorry i don't support rich guys go and google ur self

### for linux users

bruh u are already smart enuf to skip this section



## Text Editor

so now when we have all of this installed we would need some good text editor to write java code in 

don't tell u me you thought we are gonna use notepad

for text editor we are gonna use vscode [Click here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to install

while its downloading open ur file explorer and make a folder in ur Documents folder named JAVA

after u have installed it open it

then click on files (on top left) the click Open Folder then select the JAVA folder that u just created

then copy this `ext install vscjava.vscode-java-pack` and in ur vscode press ctrl + p and paste this and press enter

then u will see Extension Pack for Java on the left hand side click that an wait for it to install

when its installed press ctrl + shift + e

u will now see blank bar on right side right click there and make new file and name it Main.java

yes we write java code in .java files they are just text files but we but .java at end


WOW u have successfully setup ur computer now u are ready to code in java.


We will write our first program in next page.
