# F for Setup

Till now u know basic of computer and some very cool terms and u have setup ur text editor so we can finally start coding

## First code

```java
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java Deez Nuts");
    }
}
```

copy this code and paste in Main.java in ur text editor

Now u will see `Run | Debug`` text written in light grey which u did not even copy wtf is that

Its vscode magic its not text present in ur code they are just like buttons added by vscode so u can easily run ur code

but we are real chad people we are not gonna click that and run java easy way we are gonna do it the chad way

press `Ctrl + Shift + \``

a small window or bar what ever u call it will appear at bottom

its terminal yes u can run commands here to do stuff

don't worry now just click in that window and type `javac Main.java`

javac will do its magic and will make a new file called Main.class

that file has compiled code for the program that u just copied

now u might be thinking how do i run it

its very easy type another command `java Main`

it will run and u will see the output `Java Deez Nuts`

well done u have successfully wrote (copied) ur first java program

don't worry even programmer with 10 years of experience copy code and google dumb things you are not alone

ok now do one thing for now so u don't get confused when u code
press `ctrl + ,` then in search bar paste `java.inlayHints.parameterNames.enabled` then click on literals there and select none.

So now u know how java works java compiler takes in ur .java code and produce .class file that only jvm can understand

so now u can use that run button that vscode added for u on top of `public static void main(String[] args)` line

click that and it will run ur code also u can delete that Main.class file

when u click that run button it will automatically make a .class file then run ur code and delete it

when u click run button u will see large chunk of text and then `Java Deez Nuts` u can ignore that text its just the command that vscode use

also from now on i will don't tell u how run ur code u can google any problem ur use what ur school told u to write code u can join my discord server and ask people there i am also there i will also help

from next page i will teach u java fr
