# G for Java

## Wtf is java and wtf was that code

Java is programming language and that code was java code. like in java u have class

what is class, no its not class of students fr believe me java class are like a blueprint that jvm will see and will make object 

remember objects (yes that women joke haha) yes in java we have objects u can make a human object and add properties and behavior to it 

To make object we define what properties do the object have and behaviors can it have

in programming properties are represented as data (cuz thats why properties are) and behaviors are methods then wtf is method

Let's take the example of a T-rex. It has properties like height, color, and kill count â€“ these are just data describing the T-rex. Additionally, it has behaviors like eating, sleeping, and hunting, which are actions it can perform.

Now, what is a method? A method is merely a set of steps that define how to perform an action. In the case of the T-rex, "eat," "sleep," and "hunt" are its methods. These methods contain the instructions for carrying out these actions.


we define these data and methods in a class

also let me clear on thing when we say object they are not 1:1 (exact copy) of real things for example when we make car object in java we are not making real world car we just define data and methods that we need

for example we want to make a dog object in java

Just try to get feel of it if u don't understand its fine cuz thats why i made this site to teach u

also one more thing any thing after `//` is not a code its a comment we can type any thing after that in the same line and it will not be treated as code we use comments to make it clear what is what

```java
// This is a dog class lol
class Dog {
    // it can store number that represent age of dog
    int age;

    // define how barks
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
    // define how sleep
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Zzz");
    }
}
```

soo this is our dog class when me make a object of this class (like jvm dose it when we tell it to) jvm see this class and add age data to the dog object and then adds the bark and sleep method to it so when we want our dog to bark we use bark method on it and it will display `Woof! Woof!` on the terminal

<div class="note">
    This code will not work directly don't try to run it just try to feel it and make some sense out of it
</div>

## Wtf is public static void main(String[] arg) we saw in last page

Its the entry point when you run ur code u have many lines of code (or u can say many methods) but u don't want jvm to run any line (or method) randomly so you tell jvm that this is the entry point

JVM runs everything between curly braces `{}` of your main method

Your java application must have at least one class and one main method

Great stuff from `head first java` lol its a very good book if u don't like my style go and read it but remember u must learn java use any means possible but learn it cuz u will be kool then and who don't want to look kool in front of his friends.

### Some good image to see how java works

![HMMMMM](https://i.imgur.com/cNJX21b.png)

again good image from `head first java`

I will use many of its images cuz I am no artist and if u are plz join my discord and help me pls

again one last image then we move to next page

On next page i teach u many fun things like variables , Wtf was `System.out.println()` thing and why we have `;` at end of each line and soo much more
