# B for OP CODES

<div class="note">Op Codes = Operation code they are codes with special meaning to cpu</div>

So now u are a very literate person u know what computer is and how it works<br>
but to really make u feel what cpu instruction look like here are instruction for intel cpu to print Hello Java

```x86asm
section .data
    hello db 'Hello Java', 0   ; Null-terminated string to be printed

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Prepare to print the message
    mov eax, 4                 ; Syscall number for sys_write (4)
    mov ebx, 1                 ; File descriptor 1 (stdout)
    mov ecx, hello             ; Pointer to the message to be printed
    mov edx, 11                ; Message length (excluding null terminator)

    ; Perform the syscall to print the message
    int 0x80

    ; Exit the program
    mov eax, 1                 ; Syscall number for sys_exit (1)
    xor ebx, ebx               ; Return code 0
    int 0x80
```

Yes its scary and also not all cpu have same codes some have different and also different os has different operation codes for different stuff

But thanks to some very smart people we don't have to code like this and we have programming languages that are some what close to english with a good easy to learn syntax

Here is the java code to do the same

```java
class JavaGreat{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java");
    }
}
```

see so simple, also don't worry if u don't understand any above code u will soon but just look at this its soo much better than the code above this

Thats why u need to learn a programming language cuz its ez + u can really use ur computer to full extends and u will acquire a new servant.

So its very **KOOL**
