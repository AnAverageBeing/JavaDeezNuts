# D for Actual Start

So i was telling u random shit from i long time don't worry u will find this info i gave u very use full later just try us best rn to remember it

## Now we start with java

Lets start learning java also i will try my best to make u understand all thing but even if u have 0 IQ and u don't understand simple shit then don't worry u will see soo much code in this course that u will understand it instinctively

Before we start to learn java u must know why did humans need java and the concepts and philosophies that java follows

Programming was hard before 1972 do remember that scary code i showed u in [part 2](2.md) If u forgot here is it again

```x86asm
section .data
    hello db 'Hello Java', 0   ; Null-terminated string to be printed

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Prepare to print the message
    mov eax, 4                 ; Syscall number for sys_write (4)
    mov ebx, 1                 ; File descriptor 1 (stdout)
    mov ecx, hello             ; Pointer to the message to be printed
    mov edx, 11                ; Message length (excluding null terminator)

    ; Perform the syscall to print the message
    int 0x80

    ; Exit the program
    mov eax, 1                 ; Syscall number for sys_exit (1)
    xor ebx, ebx               ; Return code 0
    int 0x80
```

## C lang

Yes very scary this was coding before "[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language\))" was invented

C made the job for developers very easy (Still not as easy as Java) they can now write code that they can understand finally something close to english

C is very low level language that means it gave u full access lets u do anything and it gave u all the powers

But as u know **"With great power comes great responsibility" - Uncle Ben** 

But we are lazy people we don't want responsibilities we want power so java dose it for u it gives u less responsibilities but for this it don't give u all powers it keep some of them hidden also u wont need those power any time soon so don't worry

Here is a example C code

```C
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

int factorial(int n) {
    return (n == 0) ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int fibonacci(int n) {
    return (n <= 1) ? n : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

int main() {
    Point points[] = { {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6} };
    int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    int arr_size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int factorial_result = factorial(arr[arr_size - 1]);
    int fibonacci_result = fibonacci(factorial_result);

    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(points) / sizeof(points[0]); i++) {
        printf("Point %d: x = %d, y = %d\n", i + 1, points[i].x, points[i].y);
    }

    printf("Fibonacci of factorial: %d\n", fibonacci_result);
    return 0;
}
```

don't u think it looks very much like java

here is java code that dose same thing as above C code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Main {

    static class Point {
        int x;
        int y;

        public Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }

    static int factorial(int n) {
        return (n == 0) ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

    static int fibonacci(int n) {
        return (n <= 1) ? n : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point[] points = { new Point(1, 2), new Point(3, 4), new Point(5, 6) };
        int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

        int arrSize = arr.length;
        int factorialResult = factorial(arr[arrSize - 1]);
        int fibonacciResult = fibonacci(factorialResult);

        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            System.out.printf("Point %d: x = %d, y = %d\n", i + 1, points[i].x, points[i].y);
        }

        System.out.println("Fibonacci of factorial: " + fibonacciResult);
    }
}
```

It looks kinda similar thats cuz Java liked the C like syntax and they adopted most of it

Also again don't worry about all this code i am just making u get some feel so u are not scared to see code and u can just see it and feel normal

## So why did we need java when we had C

As i told u before we need power but not responsibilities and we are lazy
also C is more was old so it missed many great concepts that were introduced later
And java is relativity a easier lang than C


## Java And OOP

So before starting java here is the last concept u must know 

### OOP - Object Oriented Programming

So there are many styles of programming but the most used and what java have is OOP

So u must know something about this

In OOP everything is a object and object have data and behaviors

yes its as simple as that for example women, women are objects
women have behaviors like 

- take all money from boyfriend
- wash dishes
- and more

and they have data like

- height
- cup size
- IQ (mostly < 0)

Ya so now i am very funny u must laugh or i will come at ur home

jokes aside object have data and behaviors
data can be anything and behaviors can also be anything


So from next page we will **seriously** start with java
