# C for Servant

So as i told u computer is ur servant now we must know something about him<br>
We should understand what memory is<br>
Smart people call it RAM

We use it store values (it will remain in ram until ur pc has power)<br>
We can then ask cpu to read values from this ram and do operations

Actually when we ask cpu to perform operations on some values we store them in registers that are in cpu and they are way way faster than ram but its something u don't need to know

## What the F\*\*\* is RAM or memory

Imagine it like a very long piece of long tape with many cells

![Tape](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/turing-machine/demo_six.jpg)

Each cell can either store 0 or 1

Now u might be thinking if i have many software running on my computer they must also have many values in ram (thats why they use ram lol) how do they know where to store and what if some other program change their value in ram

Its quite advance but when for example u make a program in java when it run it ask ur OS kernel to assign it some space in memory to store values and it get those space

Another simple concept is **memory address**

its nothing imagine it like address for each cell when we store our value in ram we must have a way to get that value later so we have address its like our home we all have home (i hope u don't live on streets) and when u want a taxi driver to take u to ur home u tell him ur address and he takes u there its same here

If u don't understand any thing here don't worry u don't need to understand everything (if u need to google it urself and read) u just need to understand that u can store values in memory and can access them later.

Also u don't need to worry about how to store them and all this mess i told u java will handle it for u.
